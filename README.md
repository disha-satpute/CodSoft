## NUMBER GAME (Task 1)
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.

## STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR (Task 2)
1. Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
2. Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
3. Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.
4. Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
5. Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the use

## STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Task 3)
1. Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, rollnumber, grade, and any other relevant details.
2. Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.
3. Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
4. Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or adatabase.
5. Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
   adding a new student,
   searching for a student,
   displaying allstudents, and
   exiting the application.
6. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format

## ATM INTERFACE (Task 4)
1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions
